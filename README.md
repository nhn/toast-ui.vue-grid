## Collect statistics on the use of open source

Vue Wrapper of TOAST UI Grid applies Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI Grid is used throughout the world. It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects. location.hostname (e.g. > â€œui.toast.com") is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage. To disable GA, use the following `usageStatistics` option when declare Vue Wrapper compoent.

```js
var options = {
  ...
  usageStatistics: false
}
```

## ðŸ’¾ Install

### Using npm

```sh
npm install --save @toast-ui/vue-grid
```

## ðŸ”¡ Usage

### Load

You can use Toast UI Grid for Vue as moudule format or namespace. Also you can use Single File Component (SFC of Vue). When using module format and SFC, you should load `tui-grid.css` in the script.

* Using Ecmascript module

    ```js
    import 'tui-grid/dist/tui-grid.css'
    import { Grid } from '@toast-ui/vue-grid'
    ```

* Using Commonjs module

    ```js
    require('tui-grid/dist/tui-grid.css');
    var toastui = require('@toast-ui/vue-grid');
    var Grid = toastui.Grid;
    ```

* Using Single File Component

    ```js
    import 'tui-grid/dist/tui-grid.css'
    import Grid from '@toast-ui/vue-grid/src/Grid.vue'
    ```

* Using namespace

    ```js
    var Grid = toastui.Grid;
    ```

### Implement

First insert `<grid>` in the template or html. `rowData` and `columnData` props are required.

```html
<grid :rowData="rows" :columnData="columns" />
```

Load grid component and then add it to the `components` in your component or Vue instance.

```js
import 'tui-grid/dist/tui-grid.css'
import { Grid } from '@toast-ui/vue-grid'

export default {
  components: {
      'grid': Grid
  },
  data() {
    return {
      rows: [ // for rowData prop
        {
          name: 'Beautiful Lies',
          artist: 'Birdy'
        },
        {
          name: 'X',
          artist: 'Ed Sheeran'
        }
    ],
    columns: [ // for columnData prop
        {
          title: 'Name',
          name: 'name',
        },
        {
          title: 'Artist',
          name: 'artist'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Props

You can use `rowData`, `columnData`, `options`, `theme` and `language` props. Example of each props is in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/nhn/toast-ui.vue-grid/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#props).

* `rowData`, `columnData`

    | Type | Required |
    | --- | --- |
    | Array | O |

    These props are row and colume data of the grid. If you change `rowData` or `columnData`, the grid is rendered to change data.

* `options`

    | Type | Required |
    | --- | --- |
    | Object | X |

    You can configurate your grid using `options` prop. For more information which properties can be set in `options`, see [options of tui.grid](https://nhn.github.io/tui.grid/latest/Grid).

* `theme`

    | Type | Required |
    | --- | --- |
    | String or Object | X |

    This prop can change theme of the grid. We support `default`, `striped` and `clean` themes. So in case you just set `String` of these themes.

    If you want to use other theme, you set `Object` that is required `name` and `value`. For more information which properties of `value` are available, see `extOptions` of [applyTheme of tui.grid](https://nhn.github.io/tui.grid/latest/Grid#applyTheme).

* `language`

    | Type | Required |
    | --- | --- |
    | String or Object | X |

    This prop can change language of the grid. We support `en` and `ko`. So in case you just set `String` of these languages.

    If you want to use other languages, you set `Object` that is required `name` and `value`. For more infomation which properties of `value` are available, see `data` of [setLanguage of tui.grid](https://nhn.github.io/tui.grid/latest/Grid#setLanguage).

For more information such as the parameters of each event, see [event of tui.grid](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.grid/api/Grid.html). Example of event is in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/nhnent/toast-ui.vue-grid/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#event).

### Method

For use method, first you need to assign `ref` attribute of element like this:

```html
<grid ref="tuiGrid" :rowData="rows" :columnData="columns"/>
```

After then you can use methods through `this.$refs`. We provide `getRootElement` and `invoke` methods.

* `getRootElement`

    You can get root element of grid using this method.

    ```js
    this.$refs.tuiGrid.getRootElement();
    ```

* `invoke`

    If you want to more manipulate the Grid, you can use `invoke` method to call the method of tui.grid. First argument of `invoke` is name of the method and second argument is parameters of the method. To find out what kind of methods are available, see [method of tui.grid](http://nhn.github.io/tui.grid/latest/Grid).

    ```js
    const info = this.$refs.tuiGrid.invoke('getFocusedCell');
    this.$refs.tuiGrid.invoke('setWidth', 500);
    ```
